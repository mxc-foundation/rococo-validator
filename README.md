This project is meant for those who want to quickly spin off a polkadot validator on the rococo chain.
It's using the [docker image generated by the Parity team on the rococo-v1 branch of the polkadot project](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/rococo-v1).

Clone this project on your validator node
```
git clone https://github.com/mxc-foundation/rococo-validator.git rococo/
cd rococo
```
Then simply run ./triggerRococoUpdate.sh to pull the latest Rococo image and launch a new container with a pruged chain
```
./triggerRococoUpdate.sh 
```
Once the chain has been synced fully, generate the hash of the session key, which is then used to sign the session/setKeys extrinsics in Polkadot.JS
```
docker exec -it rococo_polkadot_1 curl http://localhost:9933  -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"author_rotateKeys" }'
```
